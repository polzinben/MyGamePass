# MyGamePass # 
---

With an estimated 1.2 Million (and growing!) games across all platforms today it can be overwhelming trying to find your next favorite game to play.  Using machine learning and natural language processing, MyGamePass intends to help solve this problem.

Situations for MyGamePass include:
- "I know I love this game (or games), how do I find more games like it?"
- "With so many options, I don't even know where to look.  What are people like me playing?"

I have built a rough prototype of a content based recommender system as well as a collaborative filtering system.

This project provides a great highlight of data analysis fundamentals as well as an understanding of more advanced concepts such as Machine Learning Pipelines as well as Natural Language Processing, Funk Singular Vector Decomposition, Cosine Similarity, and model evaluation.  Packages demonstrated include pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, nltk, and surprise.
