    "One of the most compelling ways I would discover new games as a kid was when my best friends would recommend them to me.  My cousin changed my life when he loaned me The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time as a kid and I fell in love.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experience can be taken to a whole new level with machine learning.  With extensive user engagement data, we can perform analysis to find similar user profiles as your own to predict what ratings you would give a game you've not played before.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using these predicted ratings that satisfy our requirements recommendations are provided based on playing habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrix Factorization ##\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major challenges in putting recommender system applications into production is the nearly impossible compute requirements of an in-memory system when deployed at scale.  Consider if we had 10s of millions of users and millions of games, the standard memory based collaborative filtering would become very challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution for this is Matrix Factorization.  We will be using the Funk Singular Vector Decomposition method, or FunkSVD named after the inventor Simon Funk.  It is a part of the Surprise package which has become very popular for its built-in recommender system evaluation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVD will generate a predicted rating for every user-item pair in our prepared dataset."
